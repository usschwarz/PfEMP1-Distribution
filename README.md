# PfEMP1-Distribution

This code was used to analyse and interprete the data as presented in the paper "Single molecule imaging and quantification of 
PfEMP1 adhesins on knobs of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes" by Sanchez et al. in a collaboration between the Lanzer
and Schwarz groups at the University Clinics Heidelberg and the University Heidelberg, respectively. 

The python script "density-in-sectors.py" was used to convert the measured density in x-slices to a density in circular rings 
along the arclength on the half-sphere. The script "distribution-on-half-sphere.py" generated postitions on the half-sphere that 
are used to visualize the distribution in 3D. Finally, the script "average_distances.py" is used to calculate the average nearest
neighbor distances depending on how many molecules are  placed on one knob.
